The application uses a single-page architecture with a modal-based navigation
system. Clicking any navigation item (Events, Registration, About) opens the
corresponding full-page view as a slide-in overlay powered by Framer Motion's
AnimatePresence transitions.

    - .custom-scrollbar  — Thin cyan-tinted scrollbar
    - ::selection        — Cyan text selection highlight

  Animation Patterns:
    - Slide-in pages: spring-based horizontal transitions (x: 100% → 0)
    - Staggered card reveals: sequential opacity + y-offset animations
    - Tab indicators: Framer Motion layoutId for shared layout animation
    - Rotating icons: Continuous rotation with repeat delays
    - Hover effects: Scale, color shift, border glow, image zoom
    - Radiating rings: Expanding + fading circles for success state
